## In My Own Words

To create a bootable USB for Windows 10:

1. First, download the **Windows 10 ISO file** from the Microsoft website.
2. Then, use a tool like **Rufus** or **Microsoft's Media Creation Tool**.
3. Plug in a USB with at least 8GB space.
4. Open the tool, select the ISO, choose the USB, and start the process.
5. Once done, your USB will be ready to install Windows 10 on any PC.
